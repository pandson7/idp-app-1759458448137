# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application that provides document upload, OCR extraction, classification, and summarization capabilities with a simple web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a simple web interface, so that I can process them through the IDP pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a simple upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid document THE SYSTEM SHALL store it in AWS S3 and trigger the processing pipeline
4. WHEN a document upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: OCR Processing
**User Story:** As a system, I want to extract text content from uploaded documents as key-value pairs, so that the content can be analyzed and processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document is uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger OCR processing using AWS Textract
2. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL extract content as key-value pairs in JSON format
3. WHEN the JSON is wrapped in markdown THE SYSTEM SHALL handle it correctly by extracting the JSON content
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and update the processing status

### Requirement 3: Document Classification
**User Story:** As a system, I want to classify documents into predefined categories, so that users can understand the document type.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL classify the document using Amazon Bedrock
2. WHEN classifying THE SYSTEM SHALL use these categories: Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Other
3. WHEN classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the result in the database
4. WHEN classification fails THE SYSTEM SHALL default to "Other" category and log the error

### Requirement 4: Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a summary of the document content, so that I can quickly understand the key information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN document classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a summary using Amazon Bedrock
2. WHEN summarization completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the result in the database
3. WHEN summarization fails THE SYSTEM SHALL store an error message and continue processing
4. WHEN all processing tasks complete THE SYSTEM SHALL update the document status to "completed"

### Requirement 5: Results Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the processing results in the web interface, so that I can see the extracted content, classification, and summary.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL display the OCR results, classification, and summary
2. WHEN processing is in progress THE SYSTEM SHALL show the current processing status
3. WHEN processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display error information
4. WHEN multiple documents are processed THE SYSTEM SHALL list all documents with their status

### Requirement 6: Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system, I want to store processing results in a flexible schema database, so that different document types and results can be accommodated.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing results are generated THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in DynamoDB with flexible schema
2. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL include document metadata, processing status, and results
3. WHEN querying data THE SYSTEM SHALL retrieve results efficiently for display
4. WHEN data storage fails THE SYSTEM SHALL retry and log errors appropriately

### Requirement 7: End-to-End Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the complete workflow with sample data, so that I can verify the system works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL process the sample image from the images folder
2. WHEN integration testing runs THE SYSTEM SHALL complete all processing steps successfully
3. WHEN testing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL display results in the web interface
4. WHEN the development server starts THE SYSTEM SHALL be accessible via web browser
